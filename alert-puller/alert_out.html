<p>Jasper Complex Wildfire Update: Current as of 1300 July 26, 2024<br/>Update for residents<br/>Residents and businesses of the town of Jasper, we understand that this is an incredibly difficult and challenging time but our priorities remain addressing the active fire and assessing structural damage in the community. We are happy to report all critical infrastructure has been saved. We appreciate how hard it is to wait for confirmation about your homes. <br/>Our crews continue to fight the fire and we remain focused on making it safe for the people of Jasper to come home. The area remains closed for public safety, evacuation order is still in effect. <br/>Jasper Wildfire Complex<br/>The priority for the 154 firefighters in Jasper is to put out many hot spots in the outskirts of Jasper and in the trees directly surrounding the town of Jasper and critical infrastructure. Cooler conditions are reducing fire behaviour as showers tapered off overnight. Winds are anticipated to reach up to 30 km/h and may increase fire activity. <br/>Assessments of infrastructure damages is ongoing. The damage within the townsite is estimated at around 30%. Out of a total of 1113 structures within the town, 358 have been destroyed. All critical infrastructure in Jasper was successfully protected including the hospital, emergency services building, both elementary and junior/senior schools, activity centre and wastewater treatment plant. We are grateful to our wildfire teams efforts to contain the fire and minimize the damage.<br/>Estimated fire size map<br/>The map, available in the NEWS feed, is a best available estimate based on satellite imaging and what crews have been able to see from the ground. This area is estimated to cover 36,000 hectares. <br/>The outline shown in the map represents an estimate of the furthest area burned, not what is currently burning. It is important to note that this is an estimate and will change. Within the estimated perimeter there will be areas completely burned, partially burned and areas which did not burn at all.<br/>Future maps will be refined when we can map the perimeter from the air.<br/>Jasper Complex Wildfire Update: Current as of 4:38 pm <br/><br/>Structural damage update<br/><br/>We know that people are seeing images from Jasper and are anxious for more information about the extent of impacts to the town.<br/>Structural fire protection units are still fighting fires within the town and continue to fight fires moving from one building to another. We appreciate your patience as we work to make conditions in the town safe enough for a detailed assessment to be completed.<br/>Incident Command is able to confirm that all critical infrastructure in Jasper was successfully protected including the hospital, emergency services building, both elementary and junior/senior schools, activity centre and wastewater treatment plant.<br/>Although more time is needed to complete a detailed damage assessment, it is clear that some homes and businesses have been lost.<br/>The most significant structural damage is concentrated on the west side of town, southwest of Miette Avenue. Firefighting efforts have prevented significant damage to much of the infrastructure in the east end of town. Our priority remains protecting structures that have not yet been impacted by fire.<br/>The fire also damaged a number of bridges around the town and throughout the national park, including the Moberly Bridge and the Old Fort Point Bridge. Bridges on the Icefields Parkway will need to be assessed for structural damage as well. These impacts will slow down access to the Maligne Lake and Highway 93 and it will take time for a full damage assessment to take place in these areas.<br/><br/>Wildfire update<br/><br/>Yesterday, driven by winds with gusts upwards of 100 kilometers an hour, the north and south fire both spread towards the town of Jasper and have merged together. At this time we do not have an updated size.<br/>With today’s rain and cooler temperatures, fire activity is significantly subdued. However, it is important to note that the fire is still out of control and significant work remains before conditions are safe enough to allow for limited re-entry into the park.<br/>Crews are taking advantage of today’s conditions to make progress on containing the fire and the community, before conditions return to hot and dry.<br/><br/>Disaster response<br/><br/>The Incident Management Team is growing and working in Unified Command with the Municipality of Jasper, now supported by Canada Task Force 2 (CAN-TF2). This is an All Hazards Disaster Response Team with diverse capabilities to support impacted communities across Canada responding to large-scale events, emergencies and disasters.<br/>Canada Task Force 2 is assisting the Municipality of Jasper and Parks Canada to coordinate the response to the wildfire, its impacts to the community, and support our eventual recovery. <br/>We know that the uncertainty makes this crisis even harder to bear. We will continue to provide information as soon as we are able to ensure that this information is accurate and not subject to change given the still dynamic situation.<br/><br/>𝗠𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝘆𝗼𝗿:<br/>Dear Jasperites, <br/>I write to you today with profound sorrow as we begin to come to terms with the devastating impact of last night’s wildfire that has ravaged our beloved community.

The Incident Management Team together with responders on the ground, continue to work valiantly to protect our town – our home – and to coordinate supports for evacuees in other communities. <br/><br/>I want to assure you that your Mayor and Councillors are committed to supporting our community through this truly unprecedented challenge and beyond. We will work closely with all levels of government, other organizations, and volunteers to coordinate relief efforts and provide essential resources and information.<br/><br/>Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery.<br/><br/>Please continue to be patient and take care of yourselves and your loved ones. <br/>This experience is tremendously traumatic for each of us and for the community. I encourage you to reach out to your neighbours, colleagues and friends: share your grief; share your pain; stay connected. <br/><br/>Offer a helping hand, a listening ear, a supportive word where you can, and know that we are all in this together.<br/><br/>With unwavering support and resolve,<br/><br/>Mayor Ireland<br/>_______________________<br/>Jasper, it’s hard to know where to start, but here are some resources compiled by our team: <br/><br/>𝗘𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗹𝘁𝗵<br/><br/>𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: It's normal to feel overwhelmed, anxious, or sad.
